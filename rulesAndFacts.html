    <h1>Ultimate Frisbee</h1>
    <h2>The Five Most Important Rules of Ultimate</h2>
    <p>Since Ultimate frisbee is a sport, it obviously has its own set of rules
    to make sure that the game stays somewhat orderly and doesn't get out of
    control. Here are the five most important rules of Ultimate listed from most
    important to least important:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Physical contact that affects the play is not allowed. A foul occurs
      when non-incidental physical contact occurs. Non-incidental contact means
      contact that has affected the play. Picks and screens are also considered
      fouls.</li>
      <li>A player is only allowed to pivot once while holding the disc. Moving
      the other foot that is supposed to be fixed is considered a travel and a
      foul.</li>
      <li>If a player has both feet out <em><strong>or</strong></em> one foot in
      and one foot out when he/she catches the disc, then the ruling is out, and
      it is a turnover.</li>
      <li>If a player catches the disc inbounds then runs out of bounds, then
      he/she must come back in and tap the disc on the ground to continue the
      play. If a player catches the disc and runs into the end zone, that is
      considered a walk-in, and the player must bring the disc back onto the end
      zone line and tap the disc on the ground to continue the play.</li>
      <li>If a foul is called and contested by the other player, then the
      previous play must be redone. Otherwise, if the foul was uncontested, then
      the play resumes as usual.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Fun Facts and Events</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><div id="interesting" class="purpled">There is no official referee in Ultimate Frisbee;</div> this sport is
      actually self-refereed, which means that the players and coaches all have
      to make sure that they understand the rules and can make on calls on fouls
      and outs. This can cause a lot of turmoil and arguing in Ultimate frisbee
      games, but in professional games, it is usually settled out peacefully.</li>
      <li>Ultimate frisbee was internationally recognized as a sport in 2015,
      and now, more than 80 countries participate in competitive Ultimate
      frisbee.</li>
      <li>The “real” name for the sport is actually just “Ultimate.” The term
      “frisbee” was first used by the company Wham-o Toys, which means the
      word “frisbee” isn’t technically the correct term to describe the sport
      or activity.</li>
      <li>Ultimate frisbee actually originated in Columbia High School in 1968.
      A few students who were there decided to design a club/team that would
      play a sport that would eventually be revised multiple times and would
      eventually evolve into today’s Ultimate frisbee. The rules of the game
      were also made at Columbia High School.</li>

      <hr/>
      <li>There is no set way to determine which team gets the right to decide
      offense and defense, but rock-paper-scissors is actually the most popular
      way to decide that. Another way is to flip a disc and guess if it’s going
      to land heads or tails.</li>
