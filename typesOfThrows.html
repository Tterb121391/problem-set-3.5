    <h1>Ultimate Frisbee</h1>
    <h2>Types of Throws</h2>
    <p>There are many, <em>many</em> different types of throws that are usable
    in a legitimate Ultimate match, but if you want to be just a casual player,
    then there are only three basic throws to learn. The flick of the wrist is
    key in learning to throw, and without it, your throws will just wobble and
    drop after a very short distance.</p>
    <h3>The Backhand</h3>
    <p>The backhand is usually the first type of throw the average person
    learns. Grip the frisbee with the thumb on top and the other four fingers
    supporting on the bottom. Use one leg to pivot across the other leg and
    throw. For righties, the disc is held with the right hand, and the right
    foot is used as the pivot foot (left leg stays put), and vice versa for
    lefties.</p>

    <h3>The Forehand</h3>
    <p>The forehand is thrown on the other side of the body, but the pivot foot
    stays the same. Grip the frisbee with the thumb on top, the pointer and
    middle fingers supporting on the bottom, and the ring and pinky fingers
    relaxed and not holding any part of the frisbee. Pivot outwards from the
    other leg and throw.</p>

    <h3>The Hammer</h3>
    <p>The hammer is a more advanced throw than the other two, but it is the
    most basic of the upside down throws. The grip of throwing a hammer is the
    same grip as throwing a forehand, but you are now tilting it diagonally
    above your head and throwing it from there. The pivot for throwing a hammer
    is the same as the pivot for throwing a backhand.</p>
